              In October 2007, Gwendoly Strong was born a perfectly healthy baby.
              At 9-weeks-old she was hospitalized with what was thought to be Infant Botulism,
              a serious, but treatable illness. However, just before her 6 month birthday, her parent's
              worst fears were realized when she was diagnosed with the terminal,
              degenerative disease SMA Type 1.

            <p>
              Anyone facing a terrible, life altering disease has reached a point where
              they ask, "What now?"  While hundreds of online support groups and networks do
              exist, finding answers to the questions faced everyday is often 
              the proverbial "neddle in a haystack."
            </p>
            <p>In late 2009 HelpIsHere.org intends to change all this.  We will bring the
            most important questions, answers and resources to the forefront to hopefully
            help those in need get the answers they need from those who have been there
            before them.</p>
            <p>
              To make this goal a reality, <b>we need your help.</b>  Whether it's $5 or $50, your
              contribution will make a difference.
