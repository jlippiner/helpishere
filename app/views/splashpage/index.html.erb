							In October 2007, Gwendolyn Strong was born perfectly healthy. At 9-weeks-old she was hospitalized with what was thought to be Infant Botulism, a
            serious, but treatable illness. However, just before her 6-month birthday, her parent's worst fears were realized when she was properly diagnosed with
            the terminal, degenerative disease Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA) Type 1.
						</p>
						<p>
							In the months since Gwendolyn's diagnosis her parents have been consistently frustrated by the lack of proactive, actionable
                            information to help guide them through their journey with their daughter's illness. While countless online support groups and networks
                            exist for all life-altering diseases or illnesses, efficiently finding helpful answers to the "What now?" questions leads to the
                            proverbial "needle in a haystack" -- at a time when guidance is most crucial.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Gwendolyn Strong Foundation is determined to change all this. In late 2009, HelpIsHere.org will bring the most important questions,
                            answers, and resources to the forefront to help those impacted by life-altering diseases get answers directly from those who have been
                            through it before them -- people just like them. Nothing like HelpIsHere.org exists and the need is enormous.
						</p>
						<p>
							To make HelpIsHere.org a reality, we need your help. Whether it's $5 or $50 or more, your contribution will make a difference for
                            millions of people impacted by life-altering diseases.
